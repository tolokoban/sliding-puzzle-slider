## Adding DIVs

You start with this code in the body of your HTML page:
```html
<div id="grid"></div>
```

Could you provide a function called `createCells()` that will add 15 DIVs to the __grid__ and return an array of them?
The text content of the first cell will be "1", the content of the second "2", etc.

## Styling the grid

### Simple

Could write the CSS code to get this result? You are not allowed to change the DOM.
